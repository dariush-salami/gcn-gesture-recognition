# Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (GCRNN)

The code in this repository implements sequence modeling on graph structured dataset.
Example code runs with [Penn TreeBank dataset](https://github.com/carpedm20/RCMN/tree/master/data/ptb) to predict next character, give sequence of sentence.

an efficient generalization of the
popular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to arbitrary graphs, presented in
our paper:

MichaÃ«l Defferrard, Xavier Bresson, Pierre Vandergheynst, [Convolutional Neural
Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering][arXiv], Neural
Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2016.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mdeff/cnn_graph
   cd cnn_graph
   ```

2. Install the dependencies. The code should run with TensorFlow 1.0 and newer.
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # or make install
   ```

3. Play with the Jupyter notebooks.
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Reproducing our results

Run all the notebooks to reproduce the experiments on
[MNIST](nips2016/mnist.ipynb) and [20NEWS](nips2016/20news.ipynb) presented in
the paper.
```sh
cd nips2016
make
```

## Using the model

To use our graph ConvNet on your data, you need:

1. a data matrix where each row is a sample and each column is a feature,
2. a target vector,
3. optionally, an adjacency matrix which encodes the structure as a graph.

See the [usage notebook][usage] for a simple example with fabricated data.
Please get in touch if you are unsure about applying the model to a different
setting.
